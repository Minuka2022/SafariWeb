              <h2>Exploring the Sigiriya Village Tour in Sri Lanka</h2>

              <p>
                The Sigiriya Village Tour is a popular activity among tourists
                visiting Sri Lanka. This immersive experience is provided by the
                local villagers around the iconic Sigiriya rock and offers a
                unique blend of different experiences. In this article, we delve
                into the details of this activity.
              </p>

              <h3 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px">
                What is the Sigiriya Village Tour?
              </h3>

              <p>
                The Sigiriya Village Tour offers foreigners an authentic glimpse
                into the lifestyle of ancient rural Sri Lankan people. Conducted
                in collaboration with well-organized villagers and housewives,
                tourists gain a deeper understanding of the real living style of
                the ancient Sri Lankan countryside people. You'll have the
                opportunity to explore the beauty of the Sri Lankan countryside,
                engage in traditional village activities, and experience the
                ancient modes of transportation, farming, paddy fields,
                irrigation systems, local customs, and hospitality.
              </p>

              <p>
                The tour commences with a look at the modes of transportation
                used by Sri Lankans in the past, including those used to cross
                lakes and rivers. You'll be taken across a serene lake to see
                ancient-style village houses and get a chance to experience
                parts of the daily routine of a traditional homesteader. Here,
                you can closely observe some of the tactics, tools, and cooking
                processes they use. You'll also get to taste the food they
                prepare right in front of you.
              </p>

                Experiences from the Sigiriya Village Tour
              </h3>

              <h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px">
                Bullock Cart Ride
              </h4>

              <p>
                Your tour begins with a bullock cart ride, a mode of
                transportation that was popular in Sri Lanka in the distant
                past. These carts were often used to transport goods and people
                from the capital city to the village and vice versa.
              </p>

              <p>
                Carts were also used to transport goods and people around the
                island from Colombo, even to mountainous areas like Badulla
                through challenging roads for several days. These long journey
                carts had roofs, and several carts would travel together,
                assisting each other and reciting poems. The village tour gives
                you a real sense of this mode of transport using preserved carts
                and trained bullocks.
              </p>

              <h4 style="font-weight: bold">Catamaran Boat Ride</h4>

              <img

                width="500px"
                style="margin-bottom: 25px; margin-top: 25px"
              />

              <p>
                After reaching the beautiful lake by bullock cart, you'll embark
                on a Catamaran boat ride. You'll be taken across the lake to the
                other side of the village. The rider will craft a beautiful
                necklace out of a water lily flower plucked from the lake and
                place it around your neck. If you wish, you'll also have the
                opportunity to steer the boat.
              </p>

              <h4 style="font-weight: bold">Visit to a Village House</h4>

              <img

                style="margin-bottom: 25px; margin-top: 25px"
              />

              <p>
                Post the boat ride, you'll visit a traditional village house.
                Here, you can gain insights into the homes of the Sri Lankan
                villagers of yesteryear. You'll see the roof made of coconut
                fronds, the floor made of dried soil, the kitchen used by the
                village women, and the wood stove. You'll also see some kitchen
                tools such as a mortar and stone grinding tools that have been
                in use since the last century.
              </p>

              <h4 style="font-weight: bold">Cooking Demonstration</h4>

                style="margin-bottom: 25px; margin-top: 25px"
              />

              <p>
                The village housewives will demonstrate how to prepare Sri
                Lankan food. They'll show you daily life activities such as
                grain making and coconut peeling using traditional kitchen
                equipment. Following this, they'll guide you on how to prepare a
                traditional meal using these ingredients.
              </p>

              <h4 style="font-weight: bold">Traditional Lunch Experience</h4>

              <img

                style="margin-bottom: 25px; margin-top: 25px"
              />

              <p>
                The final part of the village tour is the opportunity to savor a
                traditional meal. You'll be served food in Sri Lankan style,
                including the dishes prepared in front of you and other
                traditional food by the housekeepers. This includes traditional
                sweets as well.
